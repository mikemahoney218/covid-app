# COVID-19 Shiny App

A minimal visualization of COVID-19 cases and deaths for the United States, with ability to filter to county and by included dates and to flip between linear and logarithmic y axes. 

## Data Source

Data is sourced from [John Hopkins CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), which appears to be the most authoritative public data for the United States. Data is pulled when you load the app in your browser, so should be as up-to-date as the repo allows.
